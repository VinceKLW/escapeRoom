INTRODUCTION 
<YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE AT A TRAMPOLINE PLACE TO CELEBRATE YOUR FRIENDS BIRTHDAY. IT IS GETTING LATE AND YOU ARE ALL ASKED TO LEAVE THE PLACE AS IT IS ABOUT TO CLOSE. YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS DECIDE TO SPLIT UP AND HIDE PAST CLOSING WHEN YOU SUDDENLY HEAR A SCREECH. THE LIGHTS TURN PITCH BLACK AND YOU SCRAMBLE TO FIND YOUR FRIENDS>

<YOU’RE ALL ALONE AND YOU GO AND LOOK FOR A FLASHLIGHT. YOU REMEMBER YOU HAVE A SAFETY LIGHT CONNECTED TO YOUR LANYARD THAT YOU DROPPED IN THE FOAM PIT. YOUR HEART BEGINS TO PACE AS YOU DON’T KNOW WHERE TO GO. YOU START RUNNING IN THE DIRECTION THAT YOU REMEMBERED IT BEING IN. 
        
PUZZLE #1 
YOU CRASH INTO A CABINET AND AN ENVELOPE LANDS ON YOUR HEAD. YOU DECIDE TO TAKE IT WITH YOU AS YOU CANNOT READ IT IN THE DARK. MAYBE IT WILL BE OF HELP LATER ON. YOU CATCH A SMALL GLIMPSE OF THE FOAM PIT. BUT THERES A GATE. YOU QUICKLY CLIMB OVER THE GATE AND FALL DIRECTLY INTO THE FOAM PIT. SEARCH FOR YOUR FLASHLIGHT. > 
> enter a code found in the flashlights battery area (51246)
> Materials: Foam Pit and Envelope and Flashlight that leads to next puzzle.

PUZZLE #2 
<YOU FOUND YOUR FLASHLIGHT! YOU TURN IT ON AND FIND YOUR FRIENDS. YOU ALL IMMEDIATELY START RUNNING TO THE MAIN ENTRANCE WITH YOUR FLASHLIGHT AS YOUR GUIDE. BUT THE EXIT ISN’T THERE. NOTHING IS LIKE WHAT YOU REMEMBERED. THIS IS NO LONGER THE TRAMPOLINE PLACE. YOU SCREAM FOR HELP BUT THE ECHOES JUST BOUNCE INTO THE VAST DISTANCE. YOU REMEMBER YOU PICKED UP SOME SORT OF ENVELOPE. YOU OPEN IT AND FIND A LAB REPORT. WHAT CAN THIS MEAN?>
Try and figure out what the lab report means. 
> use a physical letter where certain letters are in bold or italics. When you put them together they make a word (which would also be a hint to a later puzzle's answer. EX. “PYRAMID” like the hierarchy of animals aka the food chain)
<YOU PUT THE CODE IN AND AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR, IT IMMEDIATELY GETS SLAMMED INTO YOUR FACES. “SOMEONE DOESN’T WANT US TO LEAVE”, YOUR FRIEND SAYS>

PUZZLE #3 
<YOU SUGGEST THAT SINCE YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE HERE ALL NIGHT AND IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO LOOK FOR FOOD. YOU GUYS BEGIN TO WANDER THIS UNKNOWN PLACE. THE PLACE THAT YOU REMEMBERED AS A TRAMPOLINE PARK. YOU WAVE YOUR FLASHLIGHT AROUND, YOU FIND A SIGN LABELED “CAFETERIA”. AS YOU ENTER THE CAFETERIA YOU FIND A LARGE PIZZA AND PLATES. YOU DISTRIBUTE IT AMONGST YOUR FRIENDS. AS YOU ALL BEGIN TO EAT IT, YOUR FRIEND (PERSON 3) ON YOUR RIGHT SAYS “WHAT IS THIS…?” THEY SPIT OUT A TOOTH.
PERSON 2: “WAS THE PIZZA THAT STALE?”
PERSON 3: “IT’S NOT MINE…” 
WHY IS THERE IS A TOOTH IN THE PIZZA? EXAMINE THE TOOTH. WHAT CAN THIS MEAN?  ENTER YOUR FINDINGS BELOW. MAYBE YOU WILL NEED THIS INFO FOR LATER. >
THE TOOTH HAS 5 ANIMALS ON IT, A LION, A MOUSE, A LADY BUG, A BIRD AND A COYOTE
> order of food chain, higher one being listed first
Material: Flashlight, a paper cutout of a big tooth.

PUZZLE #4
<YOU DECIDE IT WOULD BE BEST TO THROW THE PIZZA AWAY AND RESUME LOOKING FOR A WAY TO LEAVE THE PARK. YOU ALL GET UP TO LEAVE, BUT AS YOU DO, THE PARKS’ LIGHTS TURN RED. YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THE WALL. THERE IS SOMETHING WRITTEN THERE. IT'S YOUR NAME. AND NOT ONLY YOURS, BUT YOUR FRIENDS AS WELL.  > “
 You count the number of consonants in each player's name.
> ***need to add some sort of hint in the paragraph… if possible, in the word “name”, bold/capitalize “n” and “m” to show that they are consonants
Ex.
“Tharniha” has thrnh as the consonants so that is “5”
write in the order of player 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
You’d need to have a variable assigned to the letters and add them??
One: 
Two:
Three:
Four:
Five:
(Bc there are 5 players)
> use a switch case (but how will it know how many consonants there will be)
> Player 1: if “b” add 1, if “c” add 1, etc.
> Player 2: ^^^^^^, and so on.
  
PUZZLE #5 
YOU FINALLY OPEN THE DOOR. AS YOU WALK THROUGH A DESERTED HALLWAY, YOU NOTICE A PATTERN OF LIGHTS PLAY WITH EACH STEP YOU TAKE. WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF THE HALL, YOU SEE A SCREEN LIGHT UP THE AREA. IT SEEMS TO HAVE A LIST OF COLORS.>
> it plays a pattern, and you copy it. 3 levels, each getting harder as it goes. It's basically just a memory puzzle
